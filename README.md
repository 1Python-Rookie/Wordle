# Wordle
This is my best attempt at coding wordle
The file Worlde.py is all the code that has the user guess the word and the code gives feeback based on the letters.
The file Wordle_Lists.py are all the lists I used. 
One list is full of all the possibilities the solution of the game could be.
The other three lists are the letters in the order of a keyboard (like how the real wordle looks like). If the letters in the word you guessed are
not in the solution then it gets taken out of the appropriate list.
